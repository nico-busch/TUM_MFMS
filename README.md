# A Genetic Algorithm for the Air Taxi Hub Location Problem

This project applies a genetic algorithm to the optimization problem of locating air taxi skyport locations in metropolitan areas, called Air Taxi Hub Location Problem (ATHLP). The problem is closely related to the well-known Uncapacitated Multiple Allocation p-Hub Median Problem (UMApHMP). The study was conducted as part of the seminar "Modeling Future Mobility Systems" at the Professorship for Operations and Supply Chain Management at the TUM School of Management.

The algorithm was implemented in Python 3.7 using the packages numpy 1.17.4 and scipy 1.4.1. Moreover, the project contains several visualizations and experiments. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the commercial solver Gurobi.
